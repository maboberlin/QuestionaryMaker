The "Questionary Maker 2000" is a tool to construct and fill in questionarys.

The construction of the questionarys is based on JSON-Files, which are formatted in a distinct format as it is described in "DOC.txt".
This questionary format allows to construct all kinds of questionarys easily, using single- or multiselect answer fields.

After the questionary has been filled in, the result can be saved, either in plain text or in the JSON-Questionaty-Format described in "DOC.txt".
This allows further programmatical proceeding of the answer-data.
